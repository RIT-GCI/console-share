# 🎮 Console-Share: Your Blue Team's Secret Weapon!

## What's This All About? 🤔

Are you tired of red team shenanigans kicking you out of your grey team boxes? Sick of that one red team member who thinks they're l33t because they can kill your SSH session? Well, fear not, brave blue team defender! 

Console-Share is your new best friend in the epic battle of Cyber Defense Tactics! It's like having a secret tunnel into your Incus containers that even the most mischievous red team can't mess with. Think of it as your own personal "Keep Calm and Stay Connected" tool! 

## Features That'll Make Your Blue Team Life Easier 🌟

- Share container consoles faster than a student rushing to submit a lab report
- VM console sharing smoother than your professor's PowerPoint transitions
- Uses systemd user services (because we're too cool for basic scripts)
- VGA proxy that works like magic (but it's actually just good engineering)
- Red-team-proof* access to your systems! 

*Well, as red-team-proof as anything can be in cyber defense... let's be real here 😉

## Dependencies (AKA Your Study Group) 🔧

Like any good study group, we need a few friends to make this work:
- zenity (the friendly GUI that won't ghost you)
- jq (because parsing JSON by hand is like doing calculus without a calculator)
- socat (the networking wizard that makes the magic happen)
- virt-viewer (because sometimes you need to actually see what's going on)

## How to Use This Bad Boy 🚀

1. Install the package (easier than installing your textbooks)
2. Share your console (simpler than sharing class notes)
3. Maintain access (more reliable than your 8am class attendance)
4. Defend like a boss! 

## Warning ⚠️

This tool is so powerful, it might make your red team cry. Please use responsibly and remember: with great console access comes great responsibility!

## For When Things Go Wrong 😱

If something breaks:
1. Don't panic
2. Check if it's plugged in
3. Check if it's turned on
4. If all else fails, blame the red team

*Note: No red team members were harmed in the making of this tool... physically at least. Their pride, however...*

**Fun Fact:** This incredibly over-engineered solution cost about $50 in Claude tokens to develop. Don't believe me? Check the commit history - it's a masterpiece of AI-assisted chaos! But hey, at least it's cheaper than a textbook! 📚💸
