# Console Share Configuration File
# This file configures proxy connections to Incus instances for web terminal sharing

[global]
# Global settings apply to all proxy sections below unless explicitly overridden
#
# === REMOTE CONFIGURATION ===
# To list available remotes, run: incus remote ls
# Example output:
#   +--------+----------------------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------+--------+
#   | NAME   | URL                              | PROTOCOL       | AUTH TYPE   | PUBLIC | STATIC |
#   +--------+----------------------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------+--------+
#   | local  | unix:/var/lib/incus/unix.socket | unix (default) | tls         | NO     | NO     |
#   | remote | https://10.0.0.1:8443           | lxd            | tls         | NO     | NO     |
#   +--------+----------------------------------+-----------------+-------------+--------+--------+
#
# To add a new remote:
#   incus remote add <name> <url>
# Examples:
#   incus remote add homelab https://192.168.1.100:8443
#   incus remote add work https://incus.company.com:8443
#
# Common URL formats:
#   - Local Unix socket: unix:/var/lib/incus/unix.socket
#   - Local HTTPS: https://localhost:8443
#   - Remote HTTPS: https://hostname:8443
#   - Remote HTTPS with IP: https://192.168.1.100:8443
remote = unix:/var/lib/incus/unix.socket

# Project name in Incus (default is typically fine for most setups)
# To list available projects: incus project ls
# To create a new project: incus project create <name>
project = default

[proxy1]
# Basic local instance configuration
# List available instances: incus ls
# This will show all instances in the current project
instance = instance1
# Port that this proxy will listen on
# Must be unique per proxy and available on the system
# Connect using: telnet localhost 8001 (for containers)
#               remote-viewer spice://localhost:8001 (for VMs)
port = 8001

[proxy2]
# Example of a proxy with custom project
instance = instance2
port = 8002
# Override the global project setting for this instance
project = development
# Using default remote from global section

[proxy3]
# Example of connecting to a remote Incus host
instance = instance3
port = 8003
# Override the remote for this specific proxy
# This connects to a remote Incus server at 192.168.1.100
remote = https://192.168.1.100:8443
# You might need to use a different project on the remote
project = production

[proxy4]
# Example of connecting to a cloud-hosted Incus instance
instance = cloud-instance
port = 8004
# Remote Incus server with domain name
remote = https://incus.company.com:8443
project = cloud

[proxy5]
# Example of connecting to a local VM instance
# VMs use SPICE/VGA console instead of text console
instance = ubuntu-vm
port = 8005
# Using default remote and project from global section
# Connect using: remote-viewer spice://localhost:8005

[proxy6]
# Example of connecting to a development environment
instance = dev-container
port = 8006
# Using a specific project for development
project = development
# You can use environment-specific remotes
remote = https://dev-incus:8443

# You can add as many proxy sections as needed
# Just ensure each has a unique port number
# Format: [proxy<number>]
# Required fields: instance, port
# Optional fields: remote, project (override globals)
